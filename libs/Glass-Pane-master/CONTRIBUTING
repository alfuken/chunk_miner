Contributions, as well as suggestions, are welcome on Glass Pane.

If you'd like to contribute code, submit a pull request here on GitHub. If you 
have a suggestion or bug report, open an issue.

Code style is pretty close to Sun code conventions, but with tabs instead of 
spaces.
Don't worry too much about it, I'm not going to reject PRs just for formatting. 
If I have that much of an issue with your formatting, I'll reformat it before 
pulling it.
